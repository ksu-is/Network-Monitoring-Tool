# Network-Monitoring-Tool
Using a Raspberry Pi and Python, I am creating a network monitoring tool that will be able to detect devices that are connected to a network and be able to send alerts when a new device connects. This device will be useful in monitoring network activity and examing active connections to ensure that no suspicious entities are present on a network. This will be especially useful for personal/home networks or small business with a small number of connections. The project uses a Rasberry Pi to facilitate the operation of the device in conjucntion with Python scripts and other coding programs to contorl the device. This project is maintaind by Mason Dozier, if you would like to reach out to me to add to the project or need help with its use I can be reached at dozier84500@gmail.com
