PROJECT ROADMAP
1.create repository

  project repository created 4/8/21
  
2.Explore reference repositries

  For this project, I used the SweetSecurity respository by TravisFSmith at https://github.com/TravisFSmith/SweetSecurity.git to help guide my process and give me a solid starting point for the project. While exploring this repository i dsicovered that it was designed to be used with Linux, which is the standard operating system that comes with a Raspberry Pi. The reposity has several folders included within in. One of the folders includes several files for both client and server operations and involves the installation and control of several tools including apache, and iptables. The client subfolder also includes python code files which control certain operations such as nmap scans, downloading log files, and pulling from programs like MalciousIP, as well including files to control the importing of the actual project files for the main code. The server subfolder contains python code files that control certain server operations like log retnetion and file management. This repository also utilizes Kibana and Elasticsearch, which are data visualization tools to help users get a graphical picture of what is actually happening within their network, as well as a log stashing program to help store and analyze log files. This repository also includes files that control other functions such as error handling, firewall updating, architecture support, and many others. Overall this repository is much more advanced then the project I intend to create but it is a good starting point and help give a better understanding of what will be needed moving forward to creat a successful project. When i attempted to run this code i was not able to run the code because I do not have the proper hardware or software to fully run the code.
